# C-Codes

This repository contains the C code files I created while learning the C programming language. The repo serves as both a personal reference and a showcase of my journey through understanding the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C.

## Overview

The repository includes a variety of C programs that demonstrate basic to advanced C programming concepts. These examples range from simple "Hello World" applications to more complex topics like pointers, memory management, and data structures.

## Key Files and Descriptions

- `HelloWorld.c` - Basic Hello World program.
- `RockPaper.c` - Implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- `addresses.c` - Demonstrates the use of addresses in C.
- `arrays.c` - Examples on how to use arrays in C.
- `basics.c` - Covers the basic syntax and operations in C.
- `booleans.c` - Usage of boolean types and conditional logic.
- `car.c` - Simple example using structures to model a car.
- `conditionals.c` - Demonstrates conditional statements.
- `deallocmem.c` - Examples of dynamic memory deallocation.
- `enum.c` - Use of enums to create custom data types.
- `files.c` - File operations like reading and writing.
- `functions.c` - Function definitions and invocations.
- `memory.c` - Managing memory allocation in C.
- `operators.c` - Different types of operators in C.
- `pointers.c` - Comprehensive use of pointers.
- `strings.c` - Operations on strings in C.
- `struct.c` - Demonstrates the use of structures.
- `userinput.c` - Handling user input from the console.
- `while.c` - Examples of using while loops.
